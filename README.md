# Python3 serving model api template

A simple template for serving ML models that can and should be dockerized. In other words, this is a template for creating ML micro-services serving predictions. Created this repo since I more or less do the same procedure **every time** I create a new python API or dockerized repo. It includes pre-commit hooks cleaning up the code using `flake8`, `black` and `pre-commit`, and uses a `pre-push`-hook leveraging pytest for launching tests before every push.

Tools used:
- `virtualenv`
- pre-commit hooks
  - `pre-commit`. In the pre-commit:
    - `hadolint`
    - `black`
    - `flake8`
- `pre-push` hook: Simply a `pytest` used

## Scripts

Run all scripts standing in the main directory repo and typing into the console: `source scripts/SCRIPT_NAME`.

- `build-image.sh` - Building the actual image
- `generate_documentation.sh` - Autogenerate documentation in HTML for the repository.
- `launch-api.sh` - launch the docker image.

## Resources important to understand

Package/tool | Description | Resources
-------------|-------------|----------
 `virtualenv`  | Create a virtual environment for package management. Activate using `source venv/bin/activate`, deactivate using `deactivate` in your terminal | [Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
`pre-commit` | Tool used for creating pre-commit hooks. Before anything is committed, it needs to pass rules declared by you. | [Documentation](http://pre-commit.com/)
 `pytest` | Tool used to create tests. Run tests by simply typing `pytest` in the command line. | [Documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/)
Docker | Docker is a tool to isolate an app and its applications into a state-less environment. Pretty nice. | [More info here](https://www.docker.com/)

- `python3` and `pip3` are required.

If you decided to use this as a template for your own project, do the following:

### UNIX (MacOS or Linux)

1. Choose `Use this as template` on [the repo website](https://github.com/Filco306/serving-model-template).
2. Run `source setup.sh` to set the repo up to be done.

### Windows

Honestly, I don't know. Currently, I believe this is pretty much only UNIX-compatible. If you have insights into development on a Windows-computer, feel free to add a PR to this Readme.
